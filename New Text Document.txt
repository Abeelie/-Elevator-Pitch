Hello! My name is Abraham Elie, and I am a software developer student at Springboard bootcamp working extensively on 
learning how to develop web applications. After majoring in Business Administration, I worked for a few at non-profits as a 
wordpress developer and soon found myself wanting to learn more about the coding aspect of software development. 
I am willing to expand my horizons to projects looking for software support and consultancy.
